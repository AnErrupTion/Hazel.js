## 💁‍♀️ Getting Started

Get started by reviewing the answers to the following questions:

- [How do I report security concerns?](./SECURITY.md)
- [How should I behave here?](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [How can I help?](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

Afterward, (assuming you've already cloned the project) you can run the following commands to get started:

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

## 🦄 Voting

You can add your vote to the `votes.json` file. Just make sure to follow the format:

```json
{ "language": "C#", "reason": "C# is better than JavaScript." }
```

### 🐲 New Languages

If the language you want to cast a vote for hasn't been voted on yet, please add an entry in the [contributing documentation](./CONTRIBUTING.md) so that others know how to vote for that language and have the votes counted.

## 👾 The Battlegrounds

Keep it clean, keep it professional. Other than that, anything goes, as long as it's legal.
